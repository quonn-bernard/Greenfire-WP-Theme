/**
 * The main template file
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme
 * and one of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when WordPress does find a more specific template in the theme's root directory.
 * This template will be left blank, becasue the profile page will be rendered via a page template (profile-page.php)
 * so that the "Custom Fields" plugin can be integrated to make all content on the page dynamic and editable
 *
 * @package Greenfire
